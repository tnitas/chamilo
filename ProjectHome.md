# What is Chamilo LMS? #

It's a next generation learning content management system focusing on ease of use, re-usibality, collaboration and sharing.

# Why use Chamilo LMS? #

Chamilo is one of the easiest open-source e-learning systems you will find on the market. E-learning being all about learning specific content, we try to make our tool as invisible as possible to your learners and as useful as possible to your teachers.

Chamilo has 14 years of code history behind it, and has been thoroughly tested and adapted to teachers and students needs.

Chamilo is free and open. While official providers will provide you with professional support whenever you need it, you are in no obligation at all to use their services in order to benefit from the advantages of Chamilo. You are and always will be free to use, study, modify and distribute this software, and chances are you'll really like it.

# How can I contribute? #

First, check our contribution page: http://www.chamilo.org/contribute.
Once you know how you'd like to help us, contact us at info@chamilo.org, or through our #chamilo IRC channel on freenode (you can also get there through our web applet on http://www.chamilo.org/irc). We'll be happy to help you through the first technological barrier.

To test the latest development (minor) version of Chamilo, head to https://stable.chamilo.org/. To test the latest development ever, use https://unstable.chamilo.org (often not working!).

To download the latest code from our Mercurial repository, check the "source" tab and select the "classic" directory.

# How can I try Chamilo? #

There's a "Try it out!" link in the menu to get directly to our demo portal. The only thing you have to do is register (you'll get more possibilities registering as a teacher).

If you want to download it and install it yourself, please follow the installation guide here: http://campus.chamilo.org/documentation/installation_guide.html

# Who are we? #

Well, right here, we are the developers of Chamilo, but there is a much larger community around Chamilo. Check our website: http://www.chamilo.org
